Smart Stock & Order Management Dashboard (Shopify-like with WhatsApp Integration)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a smart and simplified stock and order management system (similar to Shopify’s Products and Orders dashboard). It is tailored for spare parts/inventory tracking across multiple warehouses with WhatsApp-based AI stock update support, PWA availability, and a user-friendly interface for both tech-enabled and non-tech-enabled users.

1.2 Scope

The system will allow:

Orders Section: Manage, track, and create customer orders.

Products Section: Manage stock, product information, warehouse locations, and usage tracking.

Smart WhatsApp Integration: Update inventory or create orders by sending product images and interacting with an AI assistant.

PWA Support: Work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices offline/online.

Analytics & Usage Tracking: Monitor how many items are used vs. unused, usage history, warehouse box tracking, and movement logs.

Target users: Small & medium businesses managing spare parts, warehouses, or distribution.

2. System Overview

Frontend: PWA (React + Tailwind + Service Workers).

Backend: Node.js (Express/NestJS) with REST APIs.

Database: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM).

WhatsApp Integration: Meta Cloud API / Twilio + AI recognition (OCR/barcode/CLIP model).

AI Features:

Product recognition from images.

Conversational AI flow for order/stock updates via WhatsApp.

Cloud Hosting: AWS/GCP/Azure with containerized services (Docker).
